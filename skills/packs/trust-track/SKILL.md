# Trust Track Pack

Use this workflow when the user needs verified, citable outputs.

## Workflow

1. Run **citation-check** on the source material or draft output.
2. Block final output until every claim is verified or corrected.

## Output Contract

- Always include verification status for every claim.
- If any claim fails, request a fix or regeneration before final delivery.
