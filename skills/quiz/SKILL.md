# Quiz

Convert AI-generated JSON quiz into NotebookLM-style interactive quiz interface. Multiple choice questions with immediate feedback, hints, completion statistics, and review mode.

## What This Skill Does

**Input**: JSON file with quiz questions (generated by AI)
**Output**: NotebookLM-style interactive HTML

This is a **pure frontend converter** - AI (Claude/Gemini) generates the quiz as JSON, this skill renders it with NotebookLM's exact UI/UX.

## Output Contract

- Produces a single HTML quiz with scoring, feedback, and review mode.
- Output file is browser-ready and does not require additional assets.

## Workflow

```
1. User: "Claude, generate a 15-question quiz about biology"
2. Claude: Generates JSON with questions, options, correct answers, explanations
3. Save JSON to file (e.g., biology_quiz.json)
4. Run from `skills/quiz`: `python main.py -i biology_quiz.json -o biology_quiz.html`
5. Open HTML → NotebookLM-style quiz interface
```

## JSON Input Format

### Option A: Simple Array
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the powerhouse of the cell?",
    "options": [
      "Nucleus",
      "Mitochondria",
      "Ribosome",
      "Golgi apparatus"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "It's responsible for energy production",
    "correctExplanation": "Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, generating ATP through cellular respiration.",
    "wrongExplanation": "The answer is mitochondria - they produce energy in the form of ATP."
  }
]
```

### Option B: With Title
```json
{
  "title": "Biology Quiz",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
      "options": [
        "Breaking down glucose",
        "Converting light to chemical energy",
        "Cell division",
        "Protein synthesis"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "hint": "It involves sunlight and chlorophyll",
      "correctExplanation": "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.",
      "wrongExplanation": "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

```bash
cd skills/quiz
python main.py --input quiz.json --output quiz.html
```

Parameters:
- `--input`, `-i`: Input JSON file (required)
- `--output`, `-o`: Output HTML file (default: quiz.html)

## Math (KaTeX)

Use LaTeX delimiters in questions, options, hints, or explanations to render formulas:

```text
$\frac{a}{b}$ inline, or $$\int_0^1 x^2\,dx$$ block
```

Notes:
- Inline math uses `$...$` and block math uses `$$...$$`.
- Escape literal dollar signs as `\$` to avoid math parsing.
- When local KaTeX assets are available, a `fonts/` folder is created next to the HTML for offline rendering.

## NotebookLM-Style Features

## Integration with AI

### Asking Claude
```
"Generate a 20-question quiz about [topic] in JSON format.
Use this structure:
[
  {
    "question": "...",
    "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "hint": "optional hint",
    "correctExplanation": "why this is right",
    "wrongExplanation": "what to know if wrong"
  }
]
"
```

### Asking Gemini
Same prompt works across any AI model that can generate structured JSON.

## JSON Field Reference

### Required Fields
- `question` (string): The question text
- `options` (array): Array of 4 answer choices
- `correctIndex` (number): Index of correct answer (0-3)

### Optional Fields
- `hint` (string): Hint text to help with the question
- `correctExplanation` (string): Explanation shown when user answers correctly
- `wrongExplanation` (string): Explanation shown when user answers incorrectly
- `explanation` (string): Fallback explanation if correctExplanation/wrongExplanation not provided

## Example Workflow

1. **Generate quiz with Claude**:
```
User: "Create a 15-question quiz about quantum physics"
Claude: Generates JSON and saves to quantum_quiz.json
```

2. **Convert to interactive HTML**:
```bash
cd skills/quiz
python main.py -i quantum_quiz.json -o quantum_quiz.html
```

3. **Take the quiz**:
- Open `quantum_quiz.html` in browser
- Answer questions with immediate feedback
- Use hints when needed
- View completion statistics
- Review answers
- Retake if desired

## Tips

- **Question quality**: Each question should test one concept
- **Options**: Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong
- **Explanations**: Provide clear, educational feedback
- **Hints**: Give helpful clues without revealing the answer
- **Quiz length**: 10-20 questions is optimal for engagement
- **Difficulty**: Mix easy, medium, and hard questions

## Customization

Want to change the colors? Edit `main.py` line 55:
```python
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

Want different option letters? Edit line 491:
```python
const letter = String.fromCharCode(65 + index); // A, B, C, D
```
