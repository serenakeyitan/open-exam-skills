# Experimental Skills (Dev Branch)

This folder contains unfinished or experimental skills (for example, audio/video overview).

Stable skills live at the repo root and ship in releases. When creating the `dev` branch, move the folders in `dev/` back to the repo root so their existing docs continue to match their paths, and keep them out of release bundles.
